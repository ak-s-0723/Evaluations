## Requirements
  - You need to set up [Git Repo](https://github.com/ak-s-0723/Assignment1) on shell where you are attempting this assignment.
  - You need to create 2 branches `multiplier` and `divider` from default branch `main`
  - You need to create `multiplier_src` branch from `multiplier`
  - Then you need to create `multiplier_tst` from `multiplier_src`

In this case, `main` will be parent to `multiplier` and `divider` and it will grandparent to `multiplier_src` and great grandparent to `multiplier_tst`.
