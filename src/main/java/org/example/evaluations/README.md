# Let's push a commit in Remote Branch

## Requirements

 - You need to set up [Git Repo](https://github.com/ak-s-0723/Assignment1) on shell where you are attempting this assignment.
 - Run `whoami` command on shell and store it's output in some variable. Let's say, I ran this command and output is `shahrukh`, so I will create a branch with name `subtractor_shahrukh`.
 - In this branch, `subtractor_shahrukh`, you need to create 2 files - subtractor.java in src package and subtractorTest.java in tst package and add code taking help from Adder and AdderTest.java.
 - Now create a commit with these files with title `Added Subtractor Functionality`.
 - Now push this commit in this branch `subtractor_shahrukh`. You will eventually get permission issue, but no problem, you can try to hit that submit button now on this assignment.

## Hints
- Please hit submit only after doing all tasks.
- In this assignment, No need to worry about java code, These are primarily testing execution of Git Commands.
